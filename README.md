I will be building a minimalistic Log application using the NodeJs framework,
HapiJs.

With this app the you will be able to take note of your progress,
by creating logs of your daily performance in whichever area you wish.

This app will start-off small and simple, allowing you to create new logs,
delete logs, view and update existing logs.

So please take into consideration that this is a work-in-progress!
